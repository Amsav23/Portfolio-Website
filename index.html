                    <p>
                        Welcome to my kitchen of creativity, where I blend the finest ingredients of code and design to 
                        whip up delightful web experiences! As an enthusiastic front-end web developer, my pantry is stocked 
                        with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a dash of React to spice things up.<br>
        
                        <br>Though I'm still preheating in the world of web development, my passion for learning keeps my skills 
                        rising. With a recipe that includes attention to detail, problem-solving, and analytical thinking, 
                        I ensure every line of code is carefully measured and mixed to perfection.<br>
        
                        <br>Organization is my secret ingredient, keeping my code neat and my projects on track. Patience is 
                        the slow-cooked method I rely on to tackle challenges and troubleshoot issues, ensuring every element 
                        is just right. Like any good chef, I strive to bring my projects to life and make every interaction 
                        seamless.<br>
        
                        <br>So, if you're ready to taste a website that's cooked to perfection, come join me in my digital 
                        kitchen. Together, we'll create something that's not only visually delicious but also a joy to use.

                    <h1>About Me</h1><br>
                    <p>
                        I originally graduated from the Montgomery County Community College of Culinary Arts in 
                        2020 with an Associates Degree in Baking and Pastry. I've worked in a number of kitchens, 
                        from the bakery section of grocery stores, to wedding cake shops, to catering kitchens. 
                        After all the hours I spent working hard in the kitchen, I felt like I wanted to take on 
                        a new challenge in my career. So after browsing job searching sites, I discovered the world 
                        of Front End Web Development around the end of 2022.<br>
    
                        <br>At the end of September 2023, I earned my certificate in Front End Web Development 
                        at <a href="https://mimo.org/">Mimo Bootcamp</a> where we covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                        and React. Ever since then, I've been working on small projects to practice and 
                        enhance my web developer skills. I use 
                        <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home/my-challenges?tab=completed">frontendmentor.io</a> 
                        to practice implementing skills that I learned from bootcamp, such as debugging code, 
                        perfecting my HTML and CSS structure and layout, strengthening my knowledge of JavaScript 
                        functions, implementing responsive designs and web accessibility, integrating the use of 
                        APIs, paying close attention to detail in my work, rereading my code critically, communicating 
                        with my mentor for feedback about my progress, and being patient and persistent in my 
                        learning and development to be a better coder each day.

                        UniLife has been my biggest project so far. It is a website for students living in 
                        the UK to filter through cities and student housing. They have the freedom to filter 
                        through criteria such as pricing, location, number of bedrooms or bathrooms, and more.

                        This is a pretend store that allows users to choose between a variety of categories, 
                        as if they were shopping online. Users have the option of "favoriting", and "unfavoriting", 
                        as many items as they'd like. Each time an item is "favorited", that data gets stored 
                        in the 'shopping cart'.
