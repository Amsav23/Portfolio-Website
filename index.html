                    <p>
                        Welcome to my kitchen of creativity, where I blend the finest ingredients of code and design to 
                        whip up delightful web experiences! As an enthusiastic front-end web developer, my pantry is stocked 
                        with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a dash of React to spice things up.<br>
        
                        <br>Though I'm still preheating in the world of web development, my passion for learning keeps my skills 
                        rising. With a recipe that includes attention to detail, problem-solving, and analytical thinking, 
                        I ensure every line of code is carefully measured and mixed to perfection.<br>
        
                        <br>Organization is my secret ingredient, keeping my code neat and my projects on track. Patience is 
                        the slow-cooked method I rely on to tackle challenges and troubleshoot issues, ensuring every element 
                        is just right. Like any good chef, I strive to bring my projects to life and make every interaction 
                        seamless.<br>
        
                        So, if you're ready to taste a website that's cooked to perfection, come join me in my digital 
                        kitchen. Together, we'll create something that's not only visually delicious but also a joy to use. 
                        Let's get cooking and make some web magic happen!

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Amyln Savarese and I am a U.S. based Front End Web Developer.</p>
                <p>
                    In September of 2023, I earned a certificate for completing the 
                    Web Development Program of the online bootcamp, Mimo Bootcamp. In addition, 
                    I previously graduated from the Culinary Arts Institute of Montgommery County 
                    Community College in 2020 with an Associates Degree in Baking and Pastry Arts.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    With my combined technological skills from coding, and my attention to detail 
                    from baking and pastry, my diverse background equips me with the skills to 
                    design, code, and modify websites that meet client specifications and optimally perform.

                    <p>
                        UniLife has been my biggest project so far. It is a website for students living in 
                        the UK to filter through cities and student housing. They have the freedom to filter 
                        through criteria such as pricing, location, number of bedrooms or bathrooms, and more.

                        Users can read details about each character, save their favorites, and even switch

                        This is a pretend store that allows users to choose between a variety of categories, 
                        as if they were shopping online. Users have the option of "favoriting", and "unfavoriting", 
                        as many items as they'd like. Each time an item is "favorited", that data gets stored 
                        in the 'shopping cart'.
