            <p>Hi! I'm Amyln and I am a recent graduate of the online Mimo Dev Bootcamp for Front End
            Web Development. I began this journey in March 2023. Before this,
            I was actually a Pastry Chef with an Associates Degree in Baking and Pastry Arts.
            My love for baking is beyong measure. I had shown an interesting in cooking and baking
            in high school, taking many Family & Consumer Science courses.</p><br>

            <p>I graduated from the Montgommery County Community College of Culinary Arts in 2020.
            I've worked in grocery stores, wedding cake shops, and the catering industry.
            In 2023, I decided I was ready for a career change to Front End
            Web Development. I knew I had a love for learning, and felt that I had the drive
            to learn coding. So, here I am, designing my own online portfolio!</p><br>
    
            <p>My goals are to practice coding everyday, improve my web development skills, and
            eventually land a job in Front End Web Development. Although I don't have many years
            of experience in this field, I am very eager to learn as much as I possibly can
            and expand my knowledge everyday.</p>
